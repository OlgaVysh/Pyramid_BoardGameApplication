## Welcome to Pyramid!

This project implements a two-player card game as a Kotlin application.

The **rules** are simple: a pyramid of cards is laid out on the table. Cards along the edges are visible, while those in the center are hidden. The objective is to remove as many visible pairs of cards as possible from the pyramid. A pair can be removed only if the sum of the two cards is 15. If no such pair is available among the visible cards, you may form a pair using one card from the pyramid and one from the reserve stack. Still no match? You can choose to pass your turn. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.
